Say Hello - Endpoint

Created an API endpoint that greets the world, or the user when a name is inputted.

1/8/24: Created the project and got it to full functionality.

Peer review: Ellie Rasuli

Ran the code and checked on Postman, it works well!
The data does not need to be a list. A string works fine
